    <h2>Marathon</h2>
    <p>The marathon is a long-distance race with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26 miles 385 yards), usually
        run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier
        Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory. The marathon can be
        completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions.

        The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become
        standardized until 1921. More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority
        of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.</p>
